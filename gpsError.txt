Explain, briefly, the main error terms contributing to positioning error in GPS satellite navigation. How are these eliminated in differential GPS? What error sources remain?



Main Error Sources 
	Propagation Medium
		1) Troposphere 
		2) Ionosphere  
	Control Segment 
		1) Navigation message errors
			1.1) Broadcast Orbits
			1.2) Broadcast Clocks 
	User Segment
		1) Multipath
		2) Receiver Clock 

Differential Error Mitigation 

	Propagation Medium
		1) Troposphere --> Mitigated with single difference 
		2) Ionosphere --> Mitigated with single difference

	Control Segment 
		1) Orbit Errors --> Mitigated with sigle difference 
		2) Satellite Clock --> Mitigated with sigle difference 
	User Segment 
		1) Multipah --> No correlation between user and reference 
				station so this error is not mitigated 
				through differential gps. And if differential
				gps is used the user inherets the reference station
				multipath error.  
		2) Receiver Clock --> Mitigated with double difference

  ** Data differencing requires short baseline ( i.e.  ~10 km )
